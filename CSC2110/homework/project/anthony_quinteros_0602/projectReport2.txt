since the last report on our progress we have made more contributions to the project
The attendee list and attendee classes are almost finished
we have been working collectively to write code and fix bugs in the code
just a few bugs, rewriting and reviewing needs to be done before we are ready
to turn in the project
anthony and john have written most of the header and source files
Caled Jaheda and I have been correcting errors, reviewing code, and writing the progress reports
we will probably be ready to submit the project soon
