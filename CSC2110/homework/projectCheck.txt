CSC 2110 Group Project Checkup

Project Group: Caleb Choi, Rory Lange, Anthony Quinteros, Jaheda Lima, Joseph Brooks
Project checkup written by Rory Lange and Caleb Choi

Anthony created a repository for the Project
Joseph and Anthony worked together on creating the classes and definitions for members
Caleb, Jaheda, and Rory plan to write the main.cpp, project checkup, and fix apparent bugs

so far we have completed header and cpp files, all that is left is to put everything together,
finish main.cpp and fix any bugs that are left in the project

we have been meeting periodically through discord and talking to each other about the project
and how we are going to solve each task
